Bandit


Read the hot hand problem

+ I need to do my own policy with no agent, or maybe an special agent (I need to read the algorithm again)
+ I dont need to implement the algorithm of the girl, I think.
+ I need to read the other paper to deal with the infinitely many arms and adapt the already implemented algorithms to the infinitely many scenario.
+ Does this one has cost? If not, I can add the ideas of the other to add the cost part!!!!


- I need to answer: "Should I keep searching? Is the best arm found already? Am I making progress looking for better arms? ... " in the problem of finding the best arm in an infinite scenario.
- I need to define the scenario in which a case of finite mandit equas a case of infinitely many bandits.
!- A ranking method for multi arms
